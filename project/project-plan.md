## Main Question

How does climate vulnerability correlate with economic development and infrastructure resilience across the countries of the Americas?

## Description

This project analyzes how climate vulnerability correlates with economic development and infrastructure resilience across the Americas. Using World Bank CCDR data, it examines climate risks (e.g., floods, droughts) alongside economic indicators like GDP per capita and infrastructure metrics such as access to clean water and disaster preparedness. By identifying patterns and correlations, we can map high-risk, low-resilience regions across North, Central, and South America. The insights aim to guide policymakers and organizations in prioritizing climate adaptation efforts for areas facing significant risks yet lacking economic or infrastructural readiness to respond effectively.
